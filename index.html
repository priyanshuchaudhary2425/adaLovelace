    <p><strong>"That brain of mine is something more than merely mortal; as time will show."</strong></p>
    <p>If we use a computer today, we owe thanks to a remarkable woman who imagined the power of machines long before computers existed ‚Äî Ada Lovelace.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="container" id="early-life">
    <h2>1. Early Life</h2>
    <img src="assets/childhood.avif" alt="Ada Lovelace as a child">
    <p>Ada Lovelace was born on December 10, 1815, in London, England. Her full name was Augusta Ada Byron, daughter of the famous poet Lord Byron and Anne Isabella Milbanke.</p>
    <p>Her mother raised her alone and focused on giving Ada a strong education in math and science to avoid her father‚Äôs unpredictable path.</p>
    <p>Even as a child, Ada showed curiosity for machines. She had private tutors and developed a passion for inventions and logic that would shape her future.</p>
  </div>

    <h2>2. Education and Influences</h2>
    <img src="assets/education.jpeg" alt="education">
    <p>Ada‚Äôs education was rare for girls in her time. She studied mathematics and science through private tutors and was mentored by Mary Somerville ‚Äî a respected female scientist.</p>
    <p>Through Mary, Ada met Charles Babbage, a mathematician working on the Analytical Engine ‚Äî an early version of the computer. This meeting sparked Ada's greatest contributions.</p>

    <h2>3. Meeting Charles Babbage and the Analytical Engine</h2>
    <img src="assets/charlsebabbage.jpeg" alt="charlse-babbage">
    <p>At age 17, Ada met Charles Babbage, known as the "father of the computer." He was designing the Analytical Engine ‚Äî a machine using punched cards to perform calculations.</p>
    <p>Unlike others, Ada imagined the machine could go beyond numbers and follow instructions to do complex tasks. Her insight impressed Babbage and began a great collaboration.</p>

    <h2>4. Translation and Notes on Menabrea‚Äôs Paper</h2>
    <img src="assets/translation.jpg" alt="translation">
    <p>In 1842, Ada translated a paper by Italian mathematician Luigi Menabrea about Babbage‚Äôs Analytical Engine. Her added notes were longer than the original.</p>
    <p>In them, she described a step-by-step method for computing Bernoulli numbers ‚Äî considered the world‚Äôs first computer program, making her the first programmer.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="container" id="vision">
    <h2>5. Vision of Computing Beyond Numbers</h2>
    <img src="assets/vision.jpeg" alt="vision">
    <p>Ada saw that computers could do more than math. She imagined they could compose music, create art, and follow general-purpose instructions ‚Äî a vision that shaped modern computing.</p>
    <blockquote>"The Analytical Engine does not occupy common ground with mere 'calculating machines'... it holds a position wholly its own."</blockquote>
  </div>

  <div class="container" id="personal-life">
    <h2>6. Personal Life</h2>
    <p>In 1835, Ada married William King, who became the Earl of Lovelace. They had three children. Ada balanced family life with her passion for science and mathematics.</p>
    <p>Despite societal limitations, she remained committed to learning and thinking deeply until her final years.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="container" id="later-years">
    <h2>7. Later Years and Health Decline</h2>
    <p>In her mid-thirties, Ada suffered from uterine cancer. The treatments were painful and ineffective, but she continued thinking and learning until her death on November 27, 1852, at just 36.</p>
    <p>She was buried beside her father, Lord Byron, as she had wished ‚Äî a symbolic connection to the parent she never knew.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="container" id="legacy">
    <h2>8. Legacy and Impact</h2>
    <img src="assets/legacy.jpeg" alt="legacy">
    <p>Ada‚Äôs notes were rediscovered in the 20th century, and she was finally recognized for her role in computing history.</p>
    <p>Today, Ada Lovelace Day celebrates women in STEM. Her name lives on in the Ada programming language and inspires generations of scientists and innovators.</p>
